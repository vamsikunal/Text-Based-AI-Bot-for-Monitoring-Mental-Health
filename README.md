# Text-Based AI Bot for Monitoring Mental Health
We have be build a model which can analyze the mental health of a person
using sentimental and emotional analysis where on the basis of the dataset, the model will be
trained. As a final product, we will build an AI-based conversational bot, where the user can
chat with the bot to check his/her emotions.

- This Block diagram gives the explanation that how a new user can use this analysis
model.
- When an individual logs in using the chat app, he mainly has two options. First, go to
dashboard for previous result visualization or start a new conversation.
