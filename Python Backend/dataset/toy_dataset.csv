"Audiard made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman, in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected... Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. Characters'description is profund, goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips, which reveals itself to be very useful for him...She will progressively evolve, far from what she was at first.It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a film noir at the end. Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play. Action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple ""etude de moeurs"". It's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10.",1
"Before he became defined as Nick Charles in the Thin Man Series, William Powell played another urbane detective named Philo Vance. The supporting cast is strong in this early talkie, and Powell's star quality is evident. Mary Astor, who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy, does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all.",1
Bela Lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie doesn't set the mood very well. Even at its worst any of Bela's movies is only mediocre though.,0
Comfort for our whole family.,1
Decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things.I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff.if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the AD police then this might up your street.but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style.Great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge/punk/post grunge bands. Worth checking out if only for the soundtrack.,0
Don't make the same mistake I did.,0
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,1
